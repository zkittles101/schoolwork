## Basic Concepts

Rigid Body: a solid body in which deformation is zero or negligible

### Kinetics and Kinematics

>Kinetics : the study of forces in systems in motion
>
>Kinematics : the study of systems in motion without the accout of force

For the practice of engineering design we consider the kinematics first BEFORE considering kinetics and forces associated with motion

One reason for this is because typically the velocity and acceleration of a system is required to determine its direction forces.

Another reason is because there are instances where the mass is constant, hence defining forces as a fuction of time. This also leads to defining stresses as a function of the applied and inertia forces and have them at acceptable limits.And since the dynamic forces are what moves machineries , their dependence on acceleration brings us back to kinematics

**A design with poor kinematics will prove troublesome and perform badly**

### Mechanisms and Machines
>
> Mechanism: a device that transforms motion in some desirable pattern with little force development and power transmission
>
> Machine: A system of elements arranged to tranform motion and energy in a predetermined fashion

**If the force/energy levels of the device is significant, its considered a *Machine*, if not its considered a *Mechanism***

**Mechanisms with light loads and slow speeds can be analyzed as kinematic devices, while Machines running at higher speeds must be treated as mechanisms**

## Kinematics Fundamentals

### Degrees of Freedom **(DOF)** or Mobility

- DOF: the number of independent variables needed to define a systems position in space at any instant of time, with respect to a selected frame of reference

> For example, a pencil placed on a piece of paper will have **3 DOF**, namely the x and y axes, and its angular coordinate $\theta$ since it exists in a 2D world. But if we put the same pencil in a 3D world (i.e. holding it above a desk), it will have **6 DOF**, namely the x,y and z axes and 3 angular coordinates $\theta$,$\phi$ and $\rho$

### Types Of Motion

Rigid bodies ,which are free to move typically have a complex motion made up of rotation and translation.

> Pure Rotation: a type of motion where a body has one center of rotation that has no motion with respect to a static frame of reference,where a reference line drawn on the body through the center only changes its angular orientation.
>
> Pure Translation: a type of motion where all the points in a body describe parallel paths to the previous position, with the drawn reference line changes its linear postion instead of its angular orientation.
>
> Complex Motion: a combination of rotation and translational motions, with the drawn reference line exhibiting both linear and angular orientation changes.

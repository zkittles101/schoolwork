1. Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Cooling Innovations for Older Vehicles Without Air Conditioning

Problem Area:
Many older vehicles in hot climates have non-functioning AC systems, leading to
extreme cabin temperatures, driver discomfort, and potential health risks.
Repairing or replacing AC systems is often costly and increases fuel
consumption.

Narrowed Topic:
Exploring energy-efficient and sustainable cooling solutions that reduce cabin
temperature without relying on traditional AC, such as improved airflow,
passive ventilation, thermal insulation, evaporative cooling, or solar-powered
devices.

Research Questions:

- What energy-efficient and sustainable cooling methods can effectively lower
  cabin temperatures in non-AC vehicles?

- How do different cooling techniques compare in terms of cost,
  efficiency, and ease of implementation?

- Can a combination of passive and active cooling strategies provide a
  reliable and eco-friendly solution?

Rationale:
Developing innovative, low-energy cooling solutions can improve vehicle
comfort, reduce fuel consumption, and promote sustainability in transportation.

# Chapter 1: Basics of Research

## 1.1 Conceptualizing research

### 1.1.1 Some Definitions

Some Definitions of the term *Research* are:

- It is a systematic investigation to find answers for a problems
- It is a systematic process of inquiry to discover, interpret or revise
  facts, theories and behaviours inorder to make practical applications
  from them

### 1.1.2 Research as a Way of Thinking

Research can be seen as :

- a habit of questioning what you do
- a habit of examining observed information to find answers
- a habit of using methods to check validity and reliability

### 1.1.3 Research as a process

Any research process should satisfy the following criteria:

- should follow a set of principles from one of the approaches of research
- must use techniques that are tested for their reliability
- must be unbiased and objective

The research process follows the following steps:

- Formulate and decide on  research problems
- Conceptualize the research design
- Plan ways on how to conduct data collection
- Select a sample
- Write a research proposal
- Collect and process data
- Write a research report

### 1.1.4 Characterstics of Research

- It is directed towards solution of a problems
- It emphasizes the development of theories that will help in predicting
  future occurences
- It is based on observable experience or emprical evidence
- It involves gathering new data or using existing data for new purposes
- It is characterized by the use of carefully designed rigourous procedures
- It requires expertise analysis
- It must be objective and logical
- It must be unhurried and or also requires courage

## 1.2 Types of Research

The nature of the problem that the research tries to solve can be
**Theoretical** or **Practical**.

Research can has main classifications based on:

- its purpose
- its nature of data
- its duration

### 1.2.1 Based on purpose

1.**Basic Research:** gathering knowledge for knowledge's sake, its main objective is toadvance knowledge and theoretical understanding.

- its *basic* because it provides the foundation for applied research

- Examples: Research on natural phenomenon, pure mathematics

2.**Applied Research:** research aiming at finding practial solutions for immediate problems. Its is done by using basic research as its basis.

- Examples: Programme Evaluation

### 1.2.2 Based on nature of data

1.**Qualitative Research:** conducted on the study of society and other natural phenomenon.

- It is flexible, uses interpretive analysis and is conducted under a small
  sample size due to its labor intensiveness

- Examples: Motivational Research (why people do certain things)

2.**Quantitative Research:** based on the measurment of quantity

- It is statistical, variable focused and requires prior categorization

**Mixed method approach** for research can be used when it is needed to utilize both types of researches at the same time

### 1.2.3 Based on Duration of Research

1.**Longitudinal Research:** research focusing on depth at a single case over a period of time

- Example: Case study

2.**Cross Sectional Research:** type of research where data is collected at a time across different targets of the study

- Example: Surveys

### 1.2.4 Research Methods

- **Surveys:** studies where several kinds of data related to a subject are
  gathered and common elements are identified

Surveys focus on broad size rather than depth, and they also arent concerned
about characterstics of individuals as individuals

- **Evaluation:** concerns with the application of research findings and
  analyzes the effectiveness based on objective values

Examples: Outcome analysis, cost benefit analysis and impact assesment

- **Case Study:** a descriptive type of research focusing on depth on a single
  study case of limited quantity of subjects, making it the opposite of surveys

Examples: Educational research

- **Experimental Research:** it is a type of research that involves the use of
  control groups ad a lab setting. It assesses cause and effects to see weather
  a cause from an external variable affects a change or an effect.

There are **Three** types of experimental design for this type of research:

1.**Pre-experimental design:** its a one group design that compares a group to
a pre-existing one before commencing the experiment

2.**True Experimental design:** experiments that have conditions, treatments
and utilize random selection. It is considered as the strongest set of design
interms of validity.

3.**Quasi-experimental design:** Shares the same characterstics as true
experimental, but uses existing groups instead of random selection

## 1.3 Research in engineering

Results of engineering research is often overlooked, yet it is essential for
progress and will continue to fuel future breakthroughs.

## 1.4 Research problem formulation

Research problems can be formulated  from:

- Experience and interest
- Other research
- sources outside your major area of study

Research problems can be formulated by:

- Find a problem area
- narrow the area to a plausible topic
- question the topic from multiple views
- define a rationale for the project

## 1.5 Literature review in research

It is a description of literature relevant to the field of study

Literature Reviews must have the following characterstics:

- be related to the research question thats being developed
- synthesize results into a summary
- formulates questions that need further research

## 1.6 Sampling technique

Sampling is the process of selecting study units from a defined population.

There are two main types od sampling, Probablity and non-probability sampling

### 1.6.1 Probablity Sampling

- **Simple Random Sampling:** It is a type of sampling where each element in the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

since the sample selection is done purely by luck, the selections might not entirely represent the entire population.

- **Systematic Sampling:** sampling technique where an inital element is
  selected randomly, and the rest of the selections beyond that are done in a
  k<sub>th</sub> interval from the initial.

Its not recommended on populations with a cyclic pattern

- **Stratified Sampling:** sampling where a cofounding variable is used to
  create classifications or *strata* , from which selections are done with SRS
  from each strata.

- **Cluster Sampling:** sampling where a grouping/cluster within a population
  is selected, where all units inside the cluster are used as the sample

- **Multistage Sampling:** it is a cluster sampling method where random
  clusters are selected from which a random sample is selected from each
  cluster. This technique may lead to a larger sampling bias and a lack of
  sampling precision.

### 1.6.2 Non-probability Sampling

- **Convenience Sampling:** sampling done by choosing the closest to convenience subjects as respondents

- **Quota Sampling:** sampling technique where each *strata* is represented based on its proportion in the entire population

- **Dimensional Sampling:** technique that represents all the variables/interests in the population in every combinations with atleast one case, suitable for small samples that demand depth on their study

- **Purposive Sampling:** technique where the researcher chooses which responder suits well for the purpose of the study, optimal for qualitative research

- **Snowball Sampling:** method of getting recommendations from a few initial respondents on who to include for the study, who then themselves also refer others.

## 1.7 Techniques of data collection

### 1.7.1 Observation

- It is the process of observing and recording events/situations
- It has two types: 
    1. **Paticipant Observation**: the researcher becomes part of the studied
       group and partakes in their activities, limited to human subjects 
    2. **Non-Participant Observation**: researcher simply observes the subjects

### 1.7.2 Questionnaire

- respondents write answers to written questions
- can be either closed choice or open ended

### 1.7.3 Interviews

- are a type of survey where the questions are presented face to face.
- can be structured or semistructured

### 1.7.4 Focus groups

- a type of interview done on select individuals who do not know each other, with the researcher acting as a moderator on group discussion

### 1.7.5 Document Analysis

- it is analysis done on pre-existing content to extract a different
  perspective from their original

### 1.7.6 The experimental method

- Involves the use of experiments to test a particular theory 

- There are two main types: 
    1.**Lab Experiment:** a controlled study where subjects can be manipulated 
    2.**Field Experiment:** less controlled but highly related is causal
    relationship

## 1.8 Data analysis and interpretation

Based on the data analysis , research can be classified into two: 

- **Quantitative Research:** involves analysis of numerical data
- **Qualitative Research:** involves analysis of non-numerical data 

# Chapter 2 : Technical Report Writing

## 2.1  Concepts of technical report writing

Technical Writing is :

- a writing done to engage in a thoughful academic discussion
- a direct literature used to comunicate factual scientific foundings

it first appeared in the 1900's , These reports, often termed "gray literature" and not typically peer-reviewed or commercially published, are disseminated to targeted audiences by sponsoring organizations like government agencies or universities.

## 2.2  Purposes and functions of technical report  

The main purpose of a technical report is to clearly and completely communicate
technical or experimental work: what was done, why, the results, and their
implications. It allows readers to quickly grasp accomplishments and alerts
researchers to new findings.

Its key features include:

- Fact-based and data-driven
- Objective and persuasive without being argumentative
- Impersonal, Does not blame individuals.
- Never hides facts or serves as advertising.
- Focuses on non-administrative issues.

## 2.3  Categories of technical report  

A formal technical has various categories

### 2.3.1 Design Report

Its purpose is to explain how a design works and how its applied, its meant for technical personnel

its sturctural elements include:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Discussion
- Conclusions
- Appendix

### 2.3.2 Lab Report

made to communicate and archive laboratory work and findings

### 2.3.3 Feasibility Report

made to assess the practicality and desirablity of a proposed project, must be unbiased and logical

### 2.3.4 Progress Report

made to describe the progress and advancement of an activity or a process

### 2.3.5 Research Report

made to present original research findings to extend understanding

## 2.4  Components of technical report  

Technical report uses a structured format and an objective style

It typically contains 3 main parts

### 2.4.1 Front Matter

- contains title,date,author
- contains a list of figutres and tables in addition to contents page
- has an infromative, abstract section

### 2.4.2 Main Text

- contains an introduction that explains why the work was done, describes the problem and provides key background

- contains a theory section that explains the technical background

- contains procedure section explaining the steps taken in the experimental
  section

- contains a result and also a conclusions section based on the results of
  the experiments and analysis

### 2.4.3 Back Matter

- Appendix, provides supplementary information
- Glossary, defines specialized terms for readers who may be unfamiliar
  with some terms
- References, listing of all sources cited in the report

## 2.5  Language of technical report writing  

Language for technical report should be clear and informative, hence it should be simple, concise and precise

### 2.5.1 Key Writing Principles

- Be concise and unambigious
- Clarity and Correctness

### 2.5.2 Pronouns, Voice and Tense

- The pronoun "I" must be avoided, unless you're a highly regarded expert

- Passive voice is used to emphasize action (" The experiment was
  conducted...") while active voice is used for directness and easier
  reading ("We conducted the experiment")

- Past tense is used for procedure, results and any action thats already
  completed, while present tense is used for established facts, theories and
  principles

- Abbreviations must be spelled out on their first occurence, equations must have their own single line

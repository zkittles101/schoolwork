## 1.1 Introduction

> __Manufacture__: manus (hand) + factus (make) => made by hand

The word "*Manufacturing*" has 2 meanings, a technological and economical one.

- **Manufacturing(*Technological Meaning*):** the application of physical and
  chemical processes to modify the properties of a given raw material and
  produce a desired end product.

- **Manufacturing(*Economical Meaning*):** the transformation of raw materials
  into a product of higher value through processing operations

## 1.2 Manufacturing Industries and Products

Manufacturing industries can be classified into **three** parts:

- **Primary Industries:** cultivate and exploit natural resources
  - Examples: Agriculture, Mining
- **Secondary Industries:** take outputs from primary industries and convert
  them into consumer and capital goods
  - Examples: Food processing, Automotive , Textile and Furniture sectors
- **Tertiary Industries:** the service sector and economy
  - Examples: Hotel, Banking, Communications

Products of manufacturing processes can be classified into **two** major
categories

- **Consumer Goods:** products made to be sold to direct consumers
  - Examples: Cars, Computers, Kitchen appliances
- **Capital Goods:** products made to be purchased by companies to produces
  goods and provide services
  - Examples: Aircraft, Railroads, Construction Equipments

## 1.3 Production Quality and Product Variety

**Production Quantity:** number of units of a product produced annually.

Annual production quantities can be classified into **three** ranges.

1. **Low Production:** 1 -- 100 units/year
2. **Medium Production:** 100 -- 10,000 units/year
3. **High Production** : 10,000 -- 1,000,000 units/year

**Product Variety:** refers to the different product types and designs that can
be produced from a single manufacturing plant.

Differences between product variety can be expressed in **two** classes:

1. **Soft Product Variety:** occurs when there's only small differences between
products.

    Example: Car models made on the same production line

2. **Hard Product Variety:** occurs when products differ substanitially and
only have few common parts

> Product variety and product quantity are **inversely related**. The higher
> the product quantity, the less the product quality, and vise versa

## 1.4 Manufacturing Capabiltiy

- The three building blocks of modern manufacturing are **materials,processes
  and systems**.

- **Manufacturing Capability:** refers to the scope of the technical and
  physical capabilities and the limitations of a manufacturing company.  

Manufacturing capability has **three** dimensions:

1. **Technological Processing Capability:** It is the the availabe
technological processing capability of a manufacturing plant and its availabe
set of manufacturing processes. This not only includes physical processes but
also the expertise processed by plant personnel in these processing
technologies.

2. **Physical Product Limitations:** It is the limitation of a production plant
due to the size and weight of the products in produces.

3. **Plant/Production Capacity:** It is the maximum rate of production that a
plant can achieve within a certain number of shifts per day/week and the labor
manpower in the plant.

## 1.5 Materials in Manufacturing

Most engineering materials can be classified into one of the three basic
categories, **Metal, Ceramics, Polymers and Composites**.

### 1.5.1 Metals

Metals in manufacturing are typically using in **alloy** form. These alloys can
be classified into two groups; **Ferrous and Non-ferrous.**  

- **Ferrous Metals:** They are alloys containing **iron** as their main
  constituent and include more than 3/4^th^ of the total metal use in the
  world.

  This group of metals include **Steel and Cast Iron**

  - **Steel:** an iron-carbon alloy containig **0.02 -- 2.11%** carbon.Its main
    applications include:

    - Bridge and beam construction
    - Truck and rail construction
    - Automobile and consumer appliances

  - **Cast Iron:** contains **2 -- 4%** of carbon. and contains Silicon(0.5 --
    3%) in addtion to other additives. It is commonly availabe in **gray cast
    iron** form.   Its common application include blocks and heads from
    combustion engines

- **Non-ferrous Metals:** are alloys that don't include iron as their main
  component. Examples include alloys of aluminium, gold, titanium ... etc.

### 1.5.2 Ceramics

Ceramics are compounds made by combination between metalic and non-metallic
elements.

Traditional ceramics including **clay, silica(glass), aluminia and silicon
carbide** have been in use for thousands of years.

Modern ceramics include **enhanced aluminiam metal carbides and nitrides(used
for cutting tools)**

Based on manufacturing processes, ceramics are grouped into two:

1.**Crystaline Ceramics:** formed from powders that are then heated below their
melting point to achieve bonding.  

2.**Glasses:** formed by melting and casting followed by glass blowing.

### 1.5.3 Polymers

Polymers are compounds by repeating of **mers**; whose atoms share electrons to
form large molecules.

Polymers are divided into **three** groups:

1. **Thermoplastic Polymers:** can be exposed to multiple heating and cooling
without it affecting its molecular structure being altered. Examples include
**Nylon, PVC, Polyethylene, Polystyrene . . . etc**

2. **Thermosetting Polymers:** polymers that transform into a rigid structure
when cooled after exposed to heat. Examples include **epoxies, amino resins**  

3. **Elastomers:** polymers that exhibit elastic behaviour. Examples include
**natural rubber, silicone, neoprene**  

### 1.5.4 Composites

**Composites** are materials made by bonding two or more materials/phases to
achieve properties superior to its constitients.

- **Phase:** refers to a homogeneous mass of material
- **Matrix:** refers to particles/fibers of one phase mixed into another

Composites can be natural (wood) or can be synthesized (epoxy-kevlar
composite,ceramic-metal matrix)

## 1.6 Manufacturing Processes

- **Manufacturing Process:** is the procedure undertaken to induces change in
  raw material to produce into something with a higher value.

Manufacturing processes can be **two** types:

### 1.6.1 Processing Operations

**Processing Operations** are a collection of operations that transfor a
working material from one state to another state that is closer to the desired
final product. This is done by changing the physical and chemical properties of
the starting material.

- **Examples:** Material removal, Heat treatment, Deformation processes

These operations may require forms of energy such as mechanical, thermal,
electrical or chemical to be applied to the working material in a controlled
manner under controlled environments.

**Material is fed into the process => Energy is applied through machinery and
toolings => Completed worked part exits the process**

**Three** categories of processing operations are performed sequentialy in most
manufacturing operations:

#### 1.6.1.1 Shaping Operations

**Shaping Operations** are operations that alter the geometry of the starting
working material.

These operations are done by applying heat, force or a combination of those to
change the shape of the workpiece.

Shaping operations can be classified into **four** based on the state of the
starting material.

1.**Solidification Processes:** the starting material is a **heated liquid**
that solidifies to form a part geometry.

Such processes can be used in fabricating metals, ceramics and plastics, which
are then poured into a mold cavity and allowed to solidify. We use the words
**Casting** for when this process is used on metals and **Molding** for when
it's used on plastics.  

2.**Particulate Processing:** the starting material is a powder, which is then
treated into desired geometry.
 
The techniques used in these processes involve **pressing and sintering**,
which are the process of squeezing the powder into a cavity under high pressure
and then heated to bond the particles together.

3.**Deformation Processes:** the starting material is a ductile solid metal,
which is then deformed into a desired shape.
 
This process is done by applying forces that exceed the yield strength ofthe
material. The material to be deformed may also be heat treated beforehand to
avoid fracture and increase ductility. Such practices include operations such
as **forging** and **extrusion**.  

4.**Material Removing Processes:** stating material is solid, which its portion
gets removed to get a desired geometry.

This is done thru machining operations such as **turning, drilling, milling and
grinding.** Non-traditional processes that involve the use of lasers can also
be used.

- **Net Shape Processes:** are manufacturing processes that transform nearly
  100% of the starting material into a product without the need for extra
  machining.

#### 1.6.1.2 Property Enhancing Processes

**Property Enhancing Processes** are types of processes done to improve the
mechanical and physical properties of the working material with no intentional
shape alteration done on it. Examples include **Heat
Treatment**(annealing,glass strengthening), **Sintering**(for powdered metals)
and **Firing**(for ceramics).

#### 1.6.1.3 Surface Processing

**Surface Processing** is mainly used for fabrication of semiconductors and
includes the following processes:

- **Cleaning:** a combination of chemical and mechanical processes to clean
  dirt, oil and other pollutants
- **Surface Treatments:** such as sand blasting , ion diffusion and ion
  implantation
- **Coating and Thin film deposition:** processes of applyinf a coating on the
  surface finish of a material, such as **electroplating, anodizing, painting**
  and or also **physical and chemical vapor deposition**

### 1.6.2 Assembly Operations

**Assembly Operations** involve the joining of two or more components to create
a new entity, connected either permanently(welding,soldering,adhesives) or
semipermanently(threaded fasteners).

### 1.6.3 Production Machines and Tooling

- **Machine Tools:** power tools used to operate cutting tools that previously
  were operated by hand.

Production Equipments can be either **general purpose** or **special purpose**
It is generally justified to invest on special purpose machinery to achieve
higher efficiency and short cycle time or when our product has unique
processing requirements.

**Tooling** is used to customize commercial general purpose machinery inorder
to cater to our product requirement and our manufacturing process.  

## 1.7 Production Systems

- **Production Systems:** consist of people, equipments and procedures designed
  for the combination of materials and processes that are part of a firm's
  manufacturing operations.

These systems can be divided into **two** categories: **Production Facilities**
and **Manufacturing Support Systems**

### 1.7.1 Production Facilities

**Production Facilities** refer to the physical equipment and its arrangement
in the factory.

Based on the planned production quantity and variety, there are **three** rangs
of annual production quantities.

1.**Low Quantity Production (1-100 units/yr):**  The term **job shop** is used
for such facilities with low production rates

Job shops have general purpose equipments, highly skilled labour and complex
products. Job shops have a **fixed-position layout**, which is a layout of
workspace where workers and equipments are brought to the product and vice
versa.

The component of these products are made in factories that have a **process
layout**; which is when equipments in factories are arranged based on function
or type. Its **advatages** are its flexibility and accomodation for various
operation sequences while its **disadvantages** include low efficiency in the
design of the machinery and methods used for this process.

2.**Medium Quantity Production (100-10,000 units/yr):**

Depending on product variety, two types of facilities are distinguished,

- **Batch Production:** once a single batch of one type of product is produced,
  equipments are changed over to produce a batch of the next type of product.

  - Advantages of this type of production is the ability to use the same
      equipments for different product batches, while the disadvantages are
      lost production time with batch swapping.

  - Batch production is commonly used to produce products to replenish
      inventory that gets gradually depleted. It also uses **process layout**
      for as its equipment arrangement layout.

- **Cellular Manufacturing:** groups of similiar products get to be produced
  using the same equipments, in **cells** containing several workstations;  for
  when there isn't much product variety.

  - Each cell specialized in the production of specific sets of similiar
      parts

3.**High Production (10,000-1,000,000 units/yr):** referred to as **mass
production**.

Based on the amounts of high quantity products , it can be grouped into **two**
types

- **Quantity production:** involves the mass production of one part type using
  standard machinery equipped with custom tooling anduses both the process and
  cellular layout for its equipments.

- **Flow line production:** type of production where workstations arranged in a
  line sequence are moved to complete the product, usually by moving between
  workstations

  - Flow line production is ideal for when there is little to no variation in
      the products. This is typically done on a **single model production
      line**, when all the products are identical andon a **mixed-model
      production line** for when there is a case of soft product variety.  

### 1.7.2 Manufacturing Support Systems

**Manufacturing Support Systems** are procedures used to manage production and
logistical issues in the entire firm's functioning.

These systems typically are divided within the following departments:

- **Manufacturing Engineering:** is responsible for choosing the processes to
  be used for the production,designing and ordering the tooling and other
  production equipment to be used for production and assembly.

- **Production planning and control:** responsible for logistics of production.

- **Quality Control:** responsible for making sure the delivered product is up
  tp specification and exceeds the customer's expectations.

## 1.8 Automation in Manufacturing

- **Automation:** the technology concerned with the application of mechanical
  and electronic systems to control production.

Automated manufacturing systems automate processing, assembly, inspection and
material handling operations. These systems can be classified into **three**
types:

1.**Fixed Automation:** the use of special equipments to automate fixed
sequences of processing.

It's characterized by:

- high initial investment and high production rate
- low product variety

2.**Programmable Automation:** use of equipments with the ability to adjust
operations to accomodate different product configurations, with the operation
being controlled by a program which can be used for different products.

Its features are:

- high initial investment and product variety
- low production rate
- suitable for batch production

3.**Flexible Automation:** its a type of programmable automation but with no
lost production caused by reprogramming

Its features include:

- high initial investment
- Medium production variety and rate
- flexibility to deal with design variations

**Reasons for automating**:

- to reduce labor cost and increase labor productivity
- to reduce/eliminate routine tasks
- to accomplush processes that cannot be done manually
